A password generator is a tool or software program designed to create unique and secure passwords for various online accounts or systems. These generators typically allow users to specify parameters such as password length, character types (including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters), and any specific requirements or restrictions.

Password generators are crucial for enhancing online security by generating strong and complex passwords that are difficult for hackers to guess or crack. They help users avoid using easily guessable or common passwords, which are vulnerable to brute-force attacks or dictionary attacks.
